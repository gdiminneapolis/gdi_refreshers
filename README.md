# Proposal: Once-a-month Review Night for GDI Class Participants

## Concept

Once a month, hold a 2-3 hour session dedicated to reviewing some
aspect of a previously held GDI class in depth.

## Desired Outcome

Students get a chance to review prior learning, dig deeper, and
practice the skills they learned in the class.

## How is this different from Toast and Tech or Code and Coffee?

This is a regularly scheduled event where everyone is focusing on the
same topic and learning structure.

- Guided learning
- Same night of the month (e.g. "First Friday")
- In a class room setting vs. coffeeshop
- Each session has a defined starting point and desired outcome

## Possible Topics

- JavaScript counter
- JavaScript photo gallery
- CSS specificity
- File and Folder structure
- Simple command line navigation
- New Project Initialization
- Creating a GitHub remote repository and connecting it to your local
  project files
- Git Branching, Merging, and Rebasing
- Finding a Hosting Solution
- Exploring cPanel
- Publishing with FTP
- Using Bootstrap
- Using Sass
- Setting up a WordPress Theme

## Leaders

I think we can easily find folks who can teach all of these things; I
can lead sessions on most of them, but I don't think it should be just
me.

I think this would be an awesome way to allow GDI students and
volunteers to take a chance at leading some instruction, too.
