# Proposal: Once-a-month Review Night for GDI Class Participants

## Concept

Once a month, hold a 2-3 hour session dedicated to reviewing some
aspect of a previously held GDI class in depth.

## Desired Outcome

Students get a chance to review prior learning, dig deeper, and
practice the skills they learned in the class.

## How is this different from Toast and Tech or Code and Coffee?

This is a regularly scheduled event where everyone is focusing on the
same topic and learning structure.

- Guided learning
- Same night of the month
- In a class room setting
- Each session has a defined starting point and desired outcome
