# Proposal: Once-a-month Review Night for GDI Class Participants

## Concept

Once a month, hold a 2-3 hour session dedicated to reviewing some
aspect of a previously held GDI class in depth.

## Desired Outcome

Students get a chance to review prior learning, dig deeper, and
practice the skills they learned in the class.

## How is this different from Toast and Tech or Code and Coffee?

This is a regularly scheduled event where everyone is focusing on the
same topic and learning structure.

- Guided learning
- Same night of the month (e.g. "First Friday")
- In a class room setting vs. coffeeshop
- Each session has a defined starting point and desired outcome

## Possible Topics

- JavaScript counter
- JavaScript photo gallery
- CSS specificity
- File and Folder structure
- Simple command line navigation
- New Project Initialization
- Creating a GitHub remote repository and connecting it to your local
  project files
- Git Branching, Merging, and Rebasing
- Finding a Hosting Solution
- Exploring cPanel
- Publishing with FTP
- Using Bootstrap
- Using Sass
- Setting up a WordPress Theme

## Leaders

I think we can easily find folks who can teach all of these things; I
can lead sessions on most of them, but I don't think it should be just
me.

I think this would be an awesome way to allow GDI students and
volunteers to take a chance at leading some instruction, too.

## Cost

This would be nominally a two hour event, which puts the standard cost
at $24. If we dropped the cost to $20 it might make the signup a
no-brainer for some people. For each session, the leader will
definitely be putting in effort to develop the exercises, so it's
worth compensating them. There's also the coordination involved and
other chapter resources.

I'm unsure about HQ policy on sponsorships, i.e., how many can be
offered, how many can an individual use, etc. How to balance the
desire to pay for instructor's time with the desire to be inclusive
and embrace diversity?

## Structure

The way the event would be structured would in a non-lecture classroom
setting, where initial instructions and guideance would be provided in
a short, 5- to 10-minute talk, ideally without slides. The majority of
the time would be working on the exercise(s) as individuals, pairs,
small groups. There would be time for discussion and sharing of
learnings near the end, and next steps students plan to take to
solidify the learning experience and bring it into practice.

Depending on the size of the group, there would likely be a need for a
couple of TAs/coaches along with the leader.

## Getting Started

We don't have to have all the details nailed down to start this. Some
questions about whether it should be the same night each month, how
much we should charge, what should the schedule of programs be, etc.,
don't need exact answers. We can start off with one offering as a
pilot program and see the level of interest.

## Judging Interest

Beforehand, we might want to run a poll providing a set of 4 topics,
and a preferred night of the week just to see if anyone responds.
