#GDI Monthly Meetup Thoughts

##Event Structure/General Idea
Host a monthly meeting in a conference type area. A range of talks would be presented after a short time to converse. The talks would range from 5-30 minutes ('lightning talks'), and would be on a diverse range of development topics.
The perks of a meetup like this would remove barricades that might normally prevent people of interest from coming out.

###For Example
* Expenses
* Social obligation. Small groups/meetups require talking, large groups can help someone initially a little less inclined to speak feel at ease.
* Time investment. Providing a range of interesting material that might   pertain to their developer interests or spark a new interest without struggling to understand it solo

##Suggested Topics
Topics should prove to be of interest to the development community and leave the audience with a new insight, knowledge, or idea.

* Short Intros to Classes
  As this would be a free event, it may provide an opportunity to show snippets of the classes available - 'pitch' lightning talks. These could partake in the lightning talk experiences and provide a short but useful bit of information

* Insightful Tips
  What helped you fully understand that new language? What was the hardest part you struggled with when working on a project?

* A Short Introduction to A Concept
  Maybe you've just learned a new language, and you want to share some of the concepts you've noticed about it or things you feel are necessary to learning this idea. This could be how you have your development setup and why, an introduction to a certain product management methodology, etc.

* Useful tools
  This would be a great speech to share a useful tool that you've noticed in your line of work, and while others might know about it, you may be able to share for what reasons you use it and how

##Thoughts on Details
###Date
A standard monthly date should be decided, one that does not conflict with other major meetups if the user is interested. As some are typically the last week of the month, I would suggest the 2nd Wednesday of the month, or something within that week.

###Time
Ideal time would post-work, and not running too late. I suggest the typical times of other meetups, where they gather at 6:30/7 for mingling, and talks begin at 7/7:30. Depending on the talks, go until 7:30 - 7:45/8:00 - 8:15 with chances to mingle after.

###Location
Work with sponsors?

###Speakers
I'm assuming it will be difficult to get speakers on the fly until the meetup is more established, so I strongly suggest that we line up speakers for the first three months, and include a talk to the audience on how easy and beneficial a lightning talk can be.

####Future Speakers
It should be strongly encouraged for the audience to feel able to open up and expand on their own experiences in a meaningful way to others.

 This is an opportunity of empowerment in sharing knowledge and creating a community that is not blockaded by experience level, price, or desire to talk or not talk, and by requiring things such as that we push people out of our desired community.
